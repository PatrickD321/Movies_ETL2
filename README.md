# Module 8 Challenge Movies ETL

## Summary
This challenge was to allow us to use the following:
### Deliverable 1
How to manipulate the use of functions in Pandas to read datafiles and convert these files into dataframes. Files were pulled from two websites wikipedia and kaggle, using the starter code provided and our understanding from this module the results were determine as in figure 1.![fig1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78861458/114310802-20cf8e80-9aba-11eb-8027-a792d145f4c0.png)

### Deliverable 2
Here we learn how use ETL (Extract Transform Load) process to remove data that are unnecessary for analysis. Extract relevant information and more importantly reduce data size to a more manageable Dataframe. Wikipedia file had many flaws, typical for file coming from that source, Modules 8 shows how special emphasis had to place on this source to clean the files and present them in a meaningful manner. The Figures below displays instances of this.![fig3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78861458/114311600-693c7b80-9abd-11eb-865a-1070f78c10e8.png)![fig2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78861458/114311479-ee736080-9abc-11eb-95ef-a8cb86dfa5fa.png)
